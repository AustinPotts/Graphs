Lecture Day 1 Notes:

- What operations would we want to run using Graph?

Network = Graph 

A: You might find where you may attack a network (Find weak part)
A: Find Shortest Path 
A: Search 
A: Store information from nodes 
A: Iterate over all nodes & perform a function on each node 
A: There are a lot of things you may want to use a network for

Stack Traversals - are Linear in Time Complexity 

Breadth First Traversal - Using Queue - First In/ First Out - Linear in Time Complexity
We select a current_node, check its friends, then deque current_node unitl empty array 
(Queue/ Dequeue)
